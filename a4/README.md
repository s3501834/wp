# Lunardo
A web programming assignment for a small cinema business

# Overview
A small cinema business called "Lunardo" (referred to hereafter as the client) is located in a medium sized country town and has asked you to develop their website to promote its business, to take online bookings (more on that in later assignment).

The Lunardo Cinema knows that cannot compete with the major chains (Village, Hoyts) which are located some distance away in larger towns and has relied too long on the loyalty and laziness of locals for business. A few months ago, the client decided to close for renovations, upgrade their cinema seating, and install new 3D projection facilities, new Dolby lighting and sound.

The client expects to have a grand reopening in a few monthsâ€™ time (ie around week 12) and would like a new website ready to launch the new cinema. Before the client decides to engage you to develop their entire website (ie assignments 3 & 4), they would like to see what you can do with the front end and design of their website: generating ideas, writing content, developing HTML forms.
